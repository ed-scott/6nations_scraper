# 6nations_scraper

This project is designed to login to fantasy 6 nations, navigate to each match and scrape the various players statistics and match results.

Once scraped, the data will be cleaned and saved locally as a CSV.

This data will then be used as part of a ML model to see how player statistics influence the outcome of match results.

# Prerequisites
