# 6nations_scraper

This project is designed to login to fantasy 6 nations, navigate to each match and scrape the various players statistics.
Once scraped, the data will be cleaned and saved locally as a CSV.
This data will then be used as part of a ML model to see how player statistics influence the outcome of match results.
